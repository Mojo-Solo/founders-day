# BDD Implementation Status - Founders Day Minnesota

## Overview

I've successfully set up Cucumber BDD testing infrastructure for the Founders Day Minnesota monorepo. The implementation follows the comprehensive plan created by the cucumber-bdd-architect and establishes a solid foundation for behavior-driven development.

## What's Been Completed

### 1. Dependencies & Configuration ✅
- Installed Cucumber.js with TypeScript support
- Configured ts-node and tsconfig-paths for proper module resolution
- Set up monorepo-compatible TypeScript configuration
- Added Chai for assertions

### 2. Project Structure ✅

└── test-setup.feature       # Verification test
```

### 3. Core Features Implemented ✅
- **World Context**: Custom FoundersDayWorld class with:
  - API client for backend communication
  - Test data management
  - Error handling and reporting attachments
  
- **Hooks**: 
  - Global setup/teardown
  - Scenario-level initialization
  - Failure debugging with automatic attachments
  - Tagged hooks for admin and payment scenarios

- **Parameter Types**:
  - Custom types for roles, ticket types, payment methods
  - Amount parsing (handles $ prefixes)
  - Email validation

- **Step Definitions**:
  - Common navigation steps
  - Registration flow steps (partial implementation)
  - Setup verification steps

### 4. Test Execution ✅
- NPM scripts configured:
  - `npm run test:cucumber` - Run all tests
  - `npm run test:cucumber:watch` - Watch mode
  - `npm run test:cucumber:smoke` - Run @smoke tagged tests
  - `npm run test:cucumber:report` - Generate HTML report

- Profile-based execution:
  - Default profile for all tests
  - Setup profile for verification tests

### 5. Verification ✅
Successfully ran test verification scenario:
```
Feature: Test Setup Verification
  Scenario: Basic setup verification ✅
    Given the test environment is configured ✅
    When I run a simple test ✅
    Then the test should pass successfully ✅
```

## Current State of Feature Files

### Existing Features (Need Step Definitions):
1. **Admin Event Management** (`features/admin/event-management.feature`)
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Capacity management
   - Email campaigns
   - Financial reporting
   - Check-in management

2. **Registration** (`features/registration/individual-registration.feature`)
   - Early bird pricing ⚠️ (partial steps)
   - Sold out scenarios
   - Form validation
   - Accessibility
   - Admin integration

3. **Payment Processing** (`features/payment/payment-processing.feature`)
   - Square integration
   - Error handling
   - Refunds

4. **User Registration** (`features/user-registration.feature`)
   - Individual registration
   - Group registration

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks:
1. **Complete Registration Steps** - Add missing step definitions for validation scenarios
2. **Admin Steps** - Implement admin dashboard step definitions
3. **Payment Steps** - Create Square payment integration steps
4. **Page Objects** - Implement page object pattern for UI testing

### Infrastructure Tasks:
1. **CI/CD Integration** - Create GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Parallel Execution** - Configure and test parallel running
3. **Reporting** - Set up comprehensive HTML/JSON reporting
4. **Test Data** - Implement proper test data factories

### Integration Tasks:
1. **Playwright Integration** - Connect Cucumber with existing Playwright setup
2. **API Testing** - Enhance API testing capabilities
3. **Database Cleanup** - Implement proper test data cleanup

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all Cucumber tests
npm run test:cucumber

# Run only smoke tests
npm run test:cucumber:smoke

# Run specific feature
npm run test:cucumber -- features/test-setup.feature

# Run with specific profile
./node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js --profile setup

# Generate HTML report
npm run test:cucumber:report
```

## Known Issues

1. **API Connection**: Registration tests fail when backend isn't running (expected)
2. **Node Version Warning**: Node v24.4.1 shows compatibility warning (works fine)
3. **Missing Steps**: Many scenarios show as undefined (need implementation)

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Structured BDD Foundation** - Clean separation of concerns
2. **TypeScript Support** - Full type safety in tests
3. **Monorepo Compatible** - Works with npm workspaces
4. **Extensible Architecture** - Easy to add new features
5. **Living Documentation** - Feature files serve as documentation
