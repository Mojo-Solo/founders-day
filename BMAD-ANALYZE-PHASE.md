# BMAD ANALYZE Phase: Root Cause Analysis

## Overview
Current state: 33% pass rate (2/6 scenarios passing)

## Root Cause Analysis by Feature

### 1. Registration Feature (UNDEFINED STEPS)
**Root Cause**: Missing step definitions for form interactions

**Missing Steps**:
- `When I fill in "First Name" with "John"`
- `And I fill in "Last Name" with "Doe"`
- `And I fill in "Email" with "john.doe@example.com"`
- `And I fill in "Password" with "SecurePass123!"`
- `And I fill in "Confirm Password" with "SecurePass123!"`
- `When I click the "Register" button`
- `Then I should see "Registration successful"`

**Issue**: The registration-steps.ts file exists but doesn't contain the necessary form interaction steps. These should likely be in a common form-steps.ts file.

### 2. Profile Management Feature (STEP MISMATCH)
**Root Cause**: Step definition pattern mismatch

**Failing Step**: Likely a mismatch between the step text in the feature file and the pattern in the step definition.

**Common Causes**:
- Quotes mismatch (single vs double)
- Parameter placeholder mismatch ({string} vs actual text)
- Missing or extra words in the pattern

### 3. Search Functionality Feature (AMBIGUOUS STEPS)
**Root Cause**: Multiple step definitions match the same step

**Issue**: Multiple step definition files contain patterns that match the same step text, causing Cucumber to be unable to determine which one to use.

**Likely Conflicts**:
- Search steps might be defined in both common/search-steps.ts and another file
- Generic patterns like "I click" might exist in multiple files

### 4. Navigation Feature (UNDEFINED)
**Root Cause**: Missing or incomplete step definitions for navigation actions

## Pattern Analysis

### Common Issues Found:
1. **Form Interactions**: No generic form filling step definitions
2. **Button Clicks**: Missing generic button click handlers
3. **Text Verification**: Missing generic text verification steps
4. **Navigation**: Incomplete navigation step definitions

## Impact Analysis

### High Priority (Blocking Multiple Tests):
1. Form field filling steps - affects registration and possibly profile
2. Button click steps - affects all features
3. Text verification steps - affects all features

### Medium Priority (Feature-Specific):
1. Profile-specific step mismatches
2. Search ambiguity resolution

### Low Priority:
1. Navigation-specific steps (if only affecting navigation feature)

## Next Steps (DECIDE Phase)

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. Create/update form-steps.ts with generic form interaction steps
2. Fix profile step definition patterns
3. Resolve search step ambiguities
4. Add missing navigation steps

### Implementation Strategy:
1. Start with highest impact fixes (form interactions)
2. Use generic, reusable step definitions where possible
3. Ensure no pattern conflicts
4. Test incrementally after each fix
