# Founders Day Platform: Implementation Roadmap
## From Prototype to Production MVP

This roadmap transforms your functional prototypes into a production-ready MVP that delivers maximum value across all 6 dimensions using real TDD standards.

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Timeline**: 8 weeks to production-ready MVP  
**Approach**: Systematic transformation from prototype to production  
**Quality Standard**: 90%+ test coverage, zero production hacks  
**Delivery Method**: Weekly sprint deliverables with client demos  

## 📋 Pre-Implementation Assessment

### Current State Analysis
```bash
# Audit existing codebase
- Functional prototypes exist in submodules
- Shared types package configured
- Monorepo structure established
- Basic functionality demonstrated

# Identify prototype limitations
- Mock data usage
- Temporary workarounds
- Missing production concerns (security, performance, monitoring)
- Lack of comprehensive testing
- No deployment pipeline
```

### Transformation Strategy
1. **Parallel Development**: Build production system alongside prototype evaluation
2. **Incremental Migration**: Move features from prototype to production iteratively
3. **Quality Gates**: Each feature must pass TDD standards before integration
4. **Client Visibility**: Weekly demos showing tangible progress
