# BMAD BUILD Phase: BDD Test Analysis

## Current Test State

Based on the provided information:
- **Total Scenarios**: 6
- **Passed**: 2 (33%)
- **Failed**: 4 (67%)

### Breakdown of Issues:
1. **Profile test**: Step definition mismatch
2. **Registration test**: Undefined steps for form filling
3. **Search test**: Ambiguous step definitions
4. **Other**: 2 undefined tests

## Step Definition Analysis

### Registration Feature Issues
The registration feature has undefined steps for:
- Form field filling (first name, last name, email, password)
- Form submission
- Success message verification

### Profile Management Issues
The profile test has a step definition mismatch, likely due to:
- Incorrect step pattern matching
- Missing or incorrectly defined steps

### Search Functionality Issues
The search test has ambiguous step definitions, meaning:
- Multiple step definitions match the same step text
- Need to disambiguate or consolidate definitions

## Key Files to Check

1. **Feature Files**:
   - `features/registration.feature`
   - `features/profile-management.feature`
   - `features/search-functionality.feature`

2. **Step Definition Files**:
   - `features/step-definitions/frontend/registration-steps.ts`
   - `features/step-definitions/profile-steps.ts`
   - `features/step-definitions/common/search-steps.ts`
   - `features/step-definitions/common/form-steps.ts`

## Next Steps (MEASURE Phase)
1. Map each failing step to its expected definition
2. Identify missing step definitions
3. Identify conflicting/ambiguous definitions
4. Create minimal fixes for 100% pass rate
