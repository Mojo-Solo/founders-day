## ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Decisions

### Decision 1: Immediate Production Readiness Focus
**Status**: âœ… APPROVED - High Priority  
**Rationale**: With deployment pipeline complete, the highest risk to production success is untested API integration

**Decision Details**:
- Prioritize API integration testing over all other features
- Allocate 60% of Sprint 1 resources to backend integration
- Delay non-critical features until integration is validated
- Establish staging environment parity with production

**Resource Allocation**:
- **Senior Developer**: 80% time on API integration
- **QA Engineer**: 100% time on integration testing
- **DevOps**: 40% time on monitoring setup

**Success Criteria**:
- 100% API endpoint coverage with real backend
- All critical user flows tested end-to-end
- Error handling validated for all failure scenarios
- Performance benchmarks established

---

### Decision 2: Monitoring-First Approach
**Status**: âœ… APPROVED - Critical Foundation  
**Rationale**: Cannot deploy to production without observability into system health and performance

**Decision Details**:
- Implement comprehensive monitoring before production deployment
- Choose enterprise-grade APM solution (New Relic or DataDog)
- Set up error tracking with Sentry
- Establish performance baselines using real user data

**Investment**:
- **APM Tool**: $200-500/month for comprehensive monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: $50-100/month for Sentry Pro
- **Development Time**: 1 week dedicated setup

**ROI Justification**:
- Prevent production issues that could cost 10x more to fix
- Enable data-driven optimization decisions
- Reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) by 80%

### Decision 3: Performance-Security-Accessibility Priority Matrix
**Status**: âœ… APPROVED - Phased Implementation  
**Rationale**: Cannot address all quality aspects simultaneously; strategic sequencing required

**Priority Sequence**:
1. **Week 1-2**: API Integration + Monitoring (Foundation)
2. **Week 3**: Performance Optimization (User Experience)
3. **Week 4**: Accessibility Audit (Compliance)
4. **Week 5**: Security Hardening (Risk Mitigation)
5. **Week 6**: Advanced Features (Enhancement)

**Resource Distribution**:
```yaml
week_1_2: 
  api_integration: 50%
  monitoring: 35%
  planning: 15%

week_3:
  performance: 70%
  accessibility_prep: 20%
  maintenance: 10%

week_4:
  accessibility: 60%
  security_prep: 25%
  performance_optimization: 15%

week_5:
  security: 50%
  advanced_features: 30%
  documentation: 20%
```

- [ ] Security: No critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Accessibility: Basic WCAG compliance verified

**No-Go Triggers** (Any one blocks deployment):
- [ ] API integration failure rate > 5%
- [ ] Performance regression > 20%
- [ ] Critical security vulnerabilities found
- [ ] Monitoring blind spots identified
- [ ] Accessibility blockers for core user flows

#### Risk Acceptance Levels
```yaml
acceptable_risks:
  performance: "Minor optimization opportunities"
  features: "Non-critical feature gaps"
  monitoring: "Some edge case blind spots"

unacceptable_risks:
  security: "Any data exposure risk"
  integration: "API compatibility issues"
  accessibility: "Core flow accessibility blockers"
  performance: "Core Web Vitals failures"
```
