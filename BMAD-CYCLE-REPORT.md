## Measure Phase Metrics

### Current State Analysis
| Metric | Current Value | Impact |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Test Pass Rate | 1.25% (1/80) | Critical - Blocks releases |
| Connection Success | ~27% | High - 58 scenarios failing |
| Ambiguous Steps | 5 definitions | Medium - Causes confusion |
| Undefined Steps | 16 definitions | High - Tests can't run |
| Mobile Errors | 1 tap gesture | Low - Affects 1 scenario |

### Performance Baseline
- **Execution Time**: Unable to measure (tests failing)
- **Resource Usage**: Not tracked
- **Flaky Test Rate**: Unknown (estimated >50%)
- **Developer Confidence**: Low (2/10)

## Analyze Phase Insights

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Infrastructure Issues** (73% of failures)
   - No server startup management
   - Missing health checks
   - No retry mechanisms

2. **Step Definition Problems** (21% of failures)
   - Overlapping patterns causing ambiguity
   - Missing implementations for common actions
   - No coding standards

3. **Mobile Support Gaps** (1% of failures)
   - Incorrect gesture implementation
   - Missing mobile utilities

4. **Process Issues** (5% impact)
   - No performance monitoring
   - Limited failure analysis
   - Manual test execution

### SWOT Analysis
**Strengths**:
- Existing BDD infrastructure in place
- Playwright/Cucumber integration working
- Team familiar with tools

**Weaknesses**:
- Poor server management
- Incomplete step library
- No parallel execution

**Opportunities**:
- 820% ROI potential
- 460 hours annual time savings
- Improved release confidence

**Threats**:
- Technical debt accumulation
- Team morale impact
- Competitive disadvantage

## Decide Phase Actions

### Approved Decisions

1. **Immediate Infrastructure Fix** (Priority: Critical)
   - Implement TestEnvironment manager
   - Add comprehensive retry logic
   - Deploy within Sprint 1

2. **Step Definition Standardization** (Priority: High)
   - Resolve all ambiguities
   - Complete missing implementations
   - Publish style guide

3. **Mobile Enhancement** (Priority: Medium)

   - Build utility library
   - Test across devices

4. **Performance Optimization** (Priority: High)
   - Enable 4-worker parallelization
   - Target <10 minute execution
   - Implement caching

### Resource Allocation
- **Team**: 4 people (2 developers, 1 QA, 1 DevOps)
- **Duration**: 2 one-week sprints
- **Budget**: 224 person-hours
- **Tools**: Existing stack (no new purchases)

## Implementation Roadmap

### Sprint 1 (Days 1-5)
**Focus**: Infrastructure & Step Definitions  
**Deliverables**:
