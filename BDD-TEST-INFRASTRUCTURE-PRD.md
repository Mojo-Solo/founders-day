## BDD Test Infrastructure - Founders Day Monorepo

## Executive Summary
This PRD outlines the systematic approach to fix and enhance the Cucumber BDD test execution infrastructure in the Founders Day monorepo. The current implementation faces TypeScript compilation errors that prevent step definitions from loading properly, blocking the entire BDD test suite from running.

## Problem Statement
- **User Problem**: Development team cannot run BDD tests due to TypeScript compilation errors in step definitions
- **Business Impact**: 
  - Blocked test automation reduces confidence in code changes
  - Manual testing increases time-to-market
  - Risk of regression bugs in production
- **Current State**: 
  - Cucumber configuration exists but fails to compile TypeScript step definitions
  - Multiple test files present but cannot execute
  - Parallel execution setup exists but is non-functional

## Solution Overview
- **Approach**: Systematic debugging and fixing of TypeScript compilation issues, followed by infrastructure hardening
- **Key Features**: 
  - Fixed TypeScript compilation for step definitions
  - Working Cucumber test execution
  - Parallel test execution capability
  - Comprehensive error reporting
  - CI/CD integration
- **Success Metrics**: 
  - 100% of BDD tests executing without compilation errors
  - < 5 minute total test execution time
  - 95%+ test reliability (no flaky tests)

## User Stories
1. As a developer, I want to run BDD tests locally so that I can verify my changes before committing
2. As a QA engineer, I want to write new Cucumber scenarios that compile and run successfully
3. As a CI/CD pipeline, I want to execute all BDD tests in parallel to provide fast feedback
4. As a team lead, I want clear test reports showing pass/fail status and failure reasons
5. As a developer, I want TypeScript type safety in step definitions to catch errors early

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture**: 
  - TypeScript-based step definitions with proper compilation
  - Playwright for browser automation
  - Cucumber for BDD framework
  - Monorepo structure with shared configurations
- **Dependencies**: 
  - @cucumber/cucumber: ^10.x
  - @playwright/test: ^1.x
  - TypeScript: ^5.x
  - ts-node for TypeScript execution
- **Performance**: 
  - Parallel execution across multiple workers
  - Test execution time < 5 minutes for full suite
  - Memory usage < 2GB per worker
- **Security**: 
  - No hardcoded credentials in tests
  - Secure handling of test data
  - Isolated test environments

## Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1**: Diagnosis and Immediate Fixes (Day 1-2)
  - Identify all TypeScript compilation errors
  - Fix import paths and module resolution
  - Ensure basic test execution works
  - Document all issues found

- **Phase 2**: Infrastructure Hardening (Day 3-4)
  - Implement proper TypeScript configuration
  - Set up proper module aliases
  - Configure test environments
  - Add comprehensive logging

- **Phase 3**: Scale and Optimize (Day 5-6)
  - Enable parallel execution
  - Optimize test performance
  - Add CI/CD integration
  - Create developer documentation

## Success Criteria
- **Quantitative**: 
  - 0 TypeScript compilation errors
  - 100% test execution rate
  - < 5 minute execution time
  - 95%+ test pass rate
  - < 1% flaky test rate
- **Qualitative**: 
  - Developer satisfaction with test infrastructure
  - Clear error messages when tests fail
  - Easy to add new test scenarios
  - Smooth CI/CD integration

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Technical Risks**: 
  - Complex monorepo structure may complicate module resolution
    - Mitigation: Use explicit path mappings and aliases
  - TypeScript version conflicts between packages
    - Mitigation: Standardize TypeScript version across monorepo
  - Playwright/Cucumber integration issues
    - Mitigation: Use proven integration patterns and official guides
- **Business Risks**: 
  - Extended downtime of test infrastructure affects release velocity
    - Mitigation: Implement fixes incrementally with quick wins first
  - Team adoption of fixed BDD framework
    - Mitigation: Provide clear documentation and training
