# Founders Day Minnesota - BMAD MVP Delivery Plan

## Executive Summary

### Current State Assessment
The Founders Day Minnesota application consists of a Next.js 15 frontend with React 19 and an Express/TypeScript backend. While significant development has occurred creating "functional prototypes," the client requires a **PRODUCTION-READY MVP** that delivers maximum value across all 6 dimensions of software quality.

### Critical Finding
The codebase has extensive features but lacks the production hardening, comprehensive testing, and operational excellence required for a true MVP launch. This plan addresses these gaps through a systematic, test-driven approach.

### MVP Vision
A fully operational event management platform that enables:
- Secure ticket purchasing and registration
- Seamless event check-in and management
- Real-time analytics and reporting
- Mobile-first experience with offline capabilities
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance
