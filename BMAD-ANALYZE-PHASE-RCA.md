# BMAD ANALYZE Phase: Root Cause Analysis

## Executive Summary
4 out of 6 scenarios are failing due to preventable mismatches between test expectations and mock implementations.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Profile Field TestId Strategy Mismatch

**Root Cause**: Conflicting design philosophies
- **Test Design**: Uses generic approach with dynamic field name construction
- **Mock Design**: Uses specific, explicit testIds for each field

**Why This Happened**:
1. Test was written to be flexible and handle any field dynamically
2. Mock was written to be explicit and clear about each field's purpose
3. No coordination between test and mock implementation

**Impact Analysis**:
- Blocks 2 critical user journeys
- Creates false negatives (tests fail but functionality could work)
- Wastes 60 seconds per test run on timeouts

### Issue 2: Registration Element Type Mismatch

**Root Cause**: Incorrect assumptions about HTML structure
- **Test Assumption**: Ticket quantity is a `<select>` dropdown
- **Mock Reality**: Ticket quantity is an `<input type="number">`

**Why This Happened**:
1. Test author assumed dropdown for quantity selection (common pattern)
2. Mock author chose number input for better UX (modern pattern)
3. No shared specification or contract between test and mock

**Impact Analysis**:
- Blocks ticket purchase flow testing
- Method `selectOption()` incompatible with input elements
- Another 60 seconds wasted on timeouts

## Deeper Analysis: Systemic Issues

### 1. Lack of Contract Testing
- No shared schema between tests and mocks
- Each implemented independently without coordination
- No validation that mocks match test expectations

### 2. Overly Rigid Test Selectors
- Tests tightly coupled to specific implementation details
- No abstraction layer for element selection
- Brittle tests that break with minor HTML changes

### 3. Timeout Strategy Issues
- 30-second timeouts for simple element lookups
- No fast-fail mechanism
- Slow feedback loop for developers

## Solution Analysis

### Option 1: Fix Tests to Match Mocks (Recommended)
**Pros**:
- Faster to implement (change 2 files)
- Mocks likely represent intended UI better
- Maintains mock simplicity

**Cons**:
- Tests become more specific
- May need updates if fields change

### Option 2: Fix Mocks to Match Tests
**Pros**:
- Tests remain generic
- No test code changes needed

**Cons**:
- More complex mock HTML
- Generic testIds less meaningful
- May not represent real implementation

### Option 3: Introduce Abstraction Layer
**Pros**:
- Long-term maintainability
- Decouples tests from implementation

**Cons**:
- More complex initial setup
- Overkill for current scope

## Recommendation
Implement **Option 1**: Update tests to match the existing mock structure. This provides the fastest path to 100% pass rate with minimal changes.

## Next Steps
- DECIDE: Implement the specific fixes
- Execute targeted changes to achieve 100% pass rate
