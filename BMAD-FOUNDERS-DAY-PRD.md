# Product Requirements Document: Founders Day Platform MVP

## Executive Summary

**Vision**: Transform the Founders Day functional prototypes into a production-ready MVP that delivers maximum value across all 6 critical dimensions, moving from "we haven't delivered anything" to "we've delivered a complete, working solution."

**Mission**: Create a comprehensive platform that enables founders to connect, collaborate, and celebrate entrepreneurial achievements through a fully functional, tested, and scalable web application.

## Problem Statement

### Current State Analysis
- **Prototype Limitation**: Existing functional prototypes demonstrate concepts but lack production readiness
- **Client Perception**: "Haven't delivered anything" because prototypes don't constitute a complete, usable product
