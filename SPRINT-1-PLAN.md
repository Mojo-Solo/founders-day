# Sprint 1 Implementation Plan: API Integration & Monitoring
*Duration: 2 weeks | Priority: Critical for Production Readiness*

## Sprint Goal
Establish real backend API integration testing and foundational production monitoring to ensure reliable production deployment.

---

## User Stories

### Epic 1: API Integration Testing
**As a** development team  
**I want** comprehensive API integration tests with the real backend  
**So that** we can deploy to production with confidence in system reliability

#### Story 1.1: Authentication Flow Testing
```gherkin
Given the real backend authentication service is available
When I test login, logout, and token refresh flows
Then all authentication scenarios work correctly with proper error handling
```

#### Story 1.2: Event Management API Testing
```gherkin
Given the events API is accessible
When I test CRUD operations for events
Then all operations work with real data validation and error responses
```

#### Story 1.3: User Management Integration
```gherkin
Given the user management backend is running
When I test user registration, profile updates, and permissions
Then all user operations integrate seamlessly
```

### Epic 2: Production Monitoring Foundation
**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** comprehensive monitoring and alerting  
**So that** we can detect and resolve production issues quickly

#### Story 2.1: Application Performance Monitoring
```gherkin
Given the application is deployed to staging
When I implement APM tools
Then we have visibility into performance metrics and bottlenecks
```

#### Story 2.2: Error Tracking Setup
```gherkin
Given the application is running
When errors occur in any environment
Then they are automatically tracked with context and alerting
```

## API Endpoints to Test (Priority Order)

### Critical Path APIs
1. **Authentication**
   ```
   POST /api/auth/login
   POST /api/auth/logout
   POST /api/auth/refresh
   POST /api/auth/reset-password
   ```

2. **Event Management**
   ```
   GET /api/events
   POST /api/events
   GET /api/events/:id
   PUT /api/events/:id
   DELETE /api/events/:id
   ```

3. **User Management**
   ```
   POST /api/users/register
   GET /api/users/profile
   PUT /api/users/profile
   GET /api/users/permissions
   ```

4. **Registration & Ticketing**
   ```
   POST /api/events/:id/register
   GET /api/users/registrations
   POST /api/payments/process
   GET /api/tickets/:id
   ```

## Monitoring Metrics to Track

### Performance Metrics
```javascript
const performanceMetrics = {
  // Core Web Vitals
  lcp: "< 2.5s",           // Largest Contentful Paint
  fid: "< 100ms",          // First Input Delay
  cls: "< 0.1",            // Cumulative Layout Shift
  
  // Application Metrics
  apiResponseTime: "< 500ms",
  pageLoadTime: "< 3s",
  errorRate: "< 1%",
  
  // Business Metrics
  registrationConversion: "> 85%",
  userSatisfaction: "> 4.5/5",
  systemUptime: "> 99.9%"
};
```

### Error Tracking Categories
```typescript
interface ErrorCategories {
  apiErrors: {
    authentication: number;
    validation: number;
    serverErrors: number;
    timeout: number;
  };
  
  clientErrors: {
    javascript: number;
    network: number;
    rendering: number;
    navigation: number;
  };
  
  businessLogic: {
    registration: number;
    payment: number;
    eventManagement: number;
  };
}
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High-Risk Scenarios
1. **Backend API Unavailability**
   - **Mitigation**: Implement circuit breaker pattern
   - **Fallback**: Graceful degradation with cached data
   - **Monitoring**: API health checks every 30 seconds

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - **Mitigation**: Performance budgets in CI/CD
   - **Fallback**: CDN and caching strategies
   - **Monitoring**: Real-time performance alerts

3. **Authentication Failures**
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive auth testing scenarios
   - **Fallback**: Clear error messages and recovery paths
   - **Monitoring**: Auth failure rate tracking
