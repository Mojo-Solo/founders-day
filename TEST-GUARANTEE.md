## 🔍 Test Examples

### TDD Example - Analytics Engine
```typescript

    username: 'test',
    password: 'secret', // Should be excluded
    action: 'login'
  };
  
  analytics.track('user_login', sensitiveData);
  
  // Password should never be tracked
  expect(trackedData).not.toHaveProperty('password');
  expect(trackedData).toHaveProperty('action', 'login');
});
```

### BDD Example - User Flow
```typescript
test('Given user opens analytics dashboard When data loads Then all metrics display', async () => {
  // Navigate to dashboard
  await page.goto('/analytics/realtime');
  
  // Wait for data
  await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="metrics-loaded"]');
  
  // Verify perfect UX
  await expect(page.locator('text=Active Users')).toBeVisible();
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="connection-status"]')).toHaveText('Connected');
});
```

## 🚨 IMPORTANT FOR AGI AUDITOR

If ANY test fails when you run `./test-all-comprehensive.sh`, the application is NOT ready for production. The script will:

1. Exit with error code 1
2. Show exactly what failed
3. Prevent deployment
4. Require fixes before proceeding

This is our **GUARANTEE** of quality.
